# StingerSpaces Deployment Status & Next Steps

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Duplicate Apartment Creation Error
- **Problem**: When searching for "100m", Google Places suggests "100midtown" but it already exists in the database, causing a duplicate key error
- **Solution**: Added duplicate checking before apartment creation - now it returns the existing apartment instead of failing

### 2. Missing Financial Columns Error  
- **Problem**: `Error: Could not find the 'hidden_fees' column of 'apartment_reviews' in the schema cache`
- **Solution**: Added graceful fallback - reviews will submit without financial data if columns don't exist

## Required Actions üö®

### 1. Run SQL Migration (CRITICAL)
You need to run the financial columns migration in Supabase:

```sql
-- Copy and paste this into your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: ADD_FINANCIAL_COLUMNS.sql (already created)
```

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire content of `ADD_FINANCIAL_COLUMNS.sql`
4. Execute it

### 2. Optional: Update Apartment Photos
Run the Python script to fetch Google Places photos and update price ranges:

```bash
cd /Users/harshshah/Documents/hackgt
pip install -r requirements_photos.txt
python scripts/update_apartment_photos.py
```

## What's Working Now ‚úÖ

1. **Apartment Search**: 
   - Searches for "100m" will find similar matches
   - Google Places suggestions won't cause duplicate errors
   - Manual apartment creation works

2. **Review Submission**:

## Testing Checklist üìã
